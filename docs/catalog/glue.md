*   **Description**:

GLUE, the General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark
(https://gluebenchmark.com/) is a collection of resources for training,
evaluating, and analyzing natural language understanding systems.

            The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability consists of English
            acceptability judgments drawn from books and journal articles on
            linguistic theory. Each example is a sequence of words annotated
            with whether it is a grammatical English sentence.

## glue/cola (default config)

*   **Config description**: The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability consists of
    English acceptability judgments drawn from books and journal articles on
    linguistic theory. Each example is a sequence of words annotated with
    whether it is a grammatical English sentence.
*   **Splits**:

## glue/sst2

*   **Config description**: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank consists of
    sentences from movie reviews and human annotations of their sentiment. The
    task is to predict the sentiment of a given sentence. We use the two-way
    (positive/negative) class split, and use only sentence-level labels.

    Brockett, 2005) is a corpus of sentence pairs automatically extracted from
    online news sources, with human annotations for whether the sentences in the
    pair are semantically equivalent.
*   **Splits**:

Split        | Examples
:----------- | -------:
'test'       | 1,725
'train'      | 3,668
'validation' | 408

## glue/qqp

*   **Config description**: The Quora Question Pairs2 dataset is a collection of
    question pairs from the community question-answering website Quora. The task
    is to determine whether a pair of questions are semantically equivalent.

## glue/stsb

*   **Config description**: The Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (Cer et
    al., 2017) is a collection of sentence pairs drawn from news headlines,
    video and image captions, and natural language inference data. Each pair is
    human-annotated with a similarity score from 1 to 5.

:----------- | -------:
'test'       | 1,379

## glue/mnli

*   **Config description**: The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpusn
    is a crowdsourced collection of sentence pairs with textual entailment
    annotations. Given a premise sentence and a hypothesis sentence, the task is
    to predict whether the premise entails the hypothesis (entailment),
    contradicts the hypothesis (contradiction), or neither (neutral). The
    premise sentences are gathered from ten different sources, including
    transcribed speech, fiction, and government reports. We use the standard
    test set, for which we obtained private labels from the authors, and
    evaluate on both the matched (in-domain) and mismatched (cross-domain)
    section. We also use and recommend the SNLI corpus as 550k examples of
    auxiliary training data.
*   **Splits**:

Split                   | Examples
:---------------------- | -------:
'test_matched'          | 9,796

## glue/qnli

*   **Config description**: The Stanford Question Answering Dataset is a
    question-answering dataset consisting of question-paragraph pairs, where one
    of the sentences in the paragraph (drawn from Wikipedia) contains the answer
    to the corresponding question (written by an annotator). We convert the task
    into sentence pair classification by forming a pair between each question
    and each sentence in the corresponding context, and filtering out pairs with
    low lexical overlap between the question and the context sentence. The task
    is to determine whether the context sentence contains the answer to the
    question. This modified version of the original task removes the requirement
    that the model select the exact answer, but also removes the simplifying
    assumptions that the answer is always present in the input and that lexical
    overlap is a reliable cue.
*   **Splits**:

Split        | Examples
:----------- | -------:
'test'       | 5,463
'train'      | 104,743
'validation' | 5,463

## glue/rte

*   **Config description**: The Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) datasets
    come from a series of annual textual entailment challenges. We combine the
    data from RTE1 (Dagan et al., 2006), RTE2 (Bar Haim et al., 2006), RTE3
    (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), and RTE5 (Bentivogli et al., 2009).4 Examples
    are constructed based on news and Wikipedia text. We convert all datasets to
    a two-class split, where for three-class datasets we collapse neutral and
    contradiction into not entailment, for consistency.
*   **Splits**:

Split        | Examples
:----------- | -------:
'test'       | 3,000
'train'      | 2,490
'validation' | 277

## glue/wnli

*   **Config description**: The Winograd Schema Challenge (Levesque et al.,
    2011) is a reading comprehension task in which a system must read a sentence
    with a pronoun and select the referent of that pronoun from a list of
    choices. The examples are manually constructed to foil simple statistical
    methods: Each one is contingent on contextual information provided by a
    single word or phrase in the sentence. To convert the problem into sentence
    pair classification, we construct sentence pairs by replacing the ambiguous
    pronoun with each possible referent. The task is to predict if the sentence
    with the pronoun substituted is entailed by the original sentence. We use a
    small evaluation set consisting of new examples derived from fiction books
    that was shared privately by the authors of the original corpus. While the
    included training set is balanced between two classes, the test set is
    imbalanced between them (65% not entailment). Also, due to a data quirk, the
    development set is adversarial: hypotheses are sometimes shared between
    training and development examples, so if a model memorizes the training
    examples, they will predict the wrong label on corresponding development set
    example. As with QNLI, each example is evaluated separately, so there is not
    a systematic correspondence between a model's score on this task and its
    score on the unconverted original task. We call converted dataset WNLI
    (Winograd NLI).

'test'       | 146
'train'      | 635
'validation' | 71

## glue/ax

*   **Config description**: A manually-curated evaluation dataset for
    fine-grained analysis of system performance on a broad range of linguistic
    phenomena. This dataset evaluates sentence understanding through Natural
    Language Inference (NLI) problems. Use a model trained on MulitNLI to
    produce predictions for this dataset.
